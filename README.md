# RFC

This is the repository where we work and keep track of the biggest RFC documents related to Amethyst.
Having this repository allows users to make changes to the RFC documents by opening pull requests that can then be reviewed by the RFC manager.

## Creating a new RFC

When creating a new RFC, we do not require a strict layout.
However, you should take inspiration of [this document](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/0000-template.md).
