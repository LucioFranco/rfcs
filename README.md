# RFC

This is the repository where we work and keep track of the all RFC documents related to Amethyst.
Having this repository allows users to participate in decision making by opening a pull request with a new document.

However, you should take inspiration of [this document](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/0000-template.md).
